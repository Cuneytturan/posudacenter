# Project Description

Nowadays, when people realize the convenience of online shopping, most of the sales are made on the internet with websites and applications. The most important tour of these products sold is kitchen products. As people spend more time at their homes in this pandemic period, they also started to spend more time in the kitchen, so they needed new and beautiful kitchen products. For this reason, I plan to use this need efficiently by making a website that sells kitchen products. While doing this project, I think of presenting the most suitable site by using html, css, php and database.

The dataset I will use on this site consists of the product list and information I created myself.
